Cat's Eye Presents: THROWBACK THURSDAY PUBNIGHT

Do the Backstreet Boys and Fall Out Boy give you the feels? Do you believe in the fortune-telling powers of cootie catchers and MASH? Do you miss the days of Baby Bottle Pops and Kool Aid? Do you ever wish you had your own Pokémon, or that you could defend the world alongside Goku? We know how you feel.

Join the Cat’s Eye for our THROWBACK PUB NIGHT on Thursday, March 12th. Rock out to the songs of your youth while getting sugar high on the candies of your childhood. Dig out your coolest 90’s gear - hoop earrings, slap bracelets, cargo shorts, aviators, and whatever else you can think of - and come out for a night of old school fun. 

Entry is FREE and there will be a 19+ wristband policy for the cash bar. Please bring valid photo ID!

Here are some more details for a ridiculously awesome night:

(shake it like a) POLAROID PICTURE
Ever wanted to immortalize yourself on polaroid film? Well now you can!
Get your hands on throwback gear and put your best face forward. We’ll have a backdrop set up all night long for you to pose in front of. It’s totally FREE, but we’ll be keeping it to one photo per person or group to give everyone a chance to get one.

BABY PHOTO CONTEST
That’s right! We’ll be hosting a contest throughout the night to see who’s got the best eye for identifying people in all of their pre-pubescent glory. 
Try your hand at matching photos from the chubby-cheeked days to current faces posted up on our walls. The first to correctly complete their scorecard (or with the most correct by the end of the night) wins a Vic scarf!

And the best part is ANYONE can be a part of it!

All you need to do is submit:
1) Your full name
2) A photo of yourself between the ages of 1 and 5 years old
3) A current photo
*NOTE: BOTH photos need to have your face clearly visible and must not contain any subject matter that could be offensive to attendees (including violence, crime, nudity, etc.)

You can either submit PHYSICAL COPIES by dropping off the pictures in a single envelope at The Cat’s Eye mailbox (located in the VUSAC office in the Goldring Student Centre) or follow THE SUBMISSION LINK BELOW to submit it online.
*DEADLINE for submissions is March 11th at 10PM
