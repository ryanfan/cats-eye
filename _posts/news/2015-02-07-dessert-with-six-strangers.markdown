In the middle of this frigid midterm season, what better to warm your spirits than free dessert and new friends!

Join us for Dessert with Six Strangers. You will be randomly allocated to a table with six Vickies you don’t know (well), stocked with desserts, chocolates, cookies, fruits, and icebreaker questions to get conversation going. You will then switch tables, to meet even more people (and food!) Halfway through, we will break away from the structured table-talk and come together for some music, dancing, and more food. During the group mingle, we will be playing a game of human bingo – winner gets the ultimate Vic prize: A VIC SCARF.

Satisfy your sweet tooth with some sweet conversation with new people.
