<p style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold">Step Four: Setting Up the Bar</p>

<p>To have the bar open, you must fill out a risk assessment form, available at: <a href="http://www.vic.utoronto.ca/students/campuslife/events/eventplanning.htm">Risk Assessment</a></p>

After booking your slot with us, contact either the campus or residence life coordinators, who will take you through your risk assessment and ultimately book the bar through Food Services. Only once they have approved your event will the bar be officially open.

    <li>Bergita Petro (Campus Life Coordinator): bergi.petro@utoronto.ca</li>
    <li>Shainiya Balachandran (Residence Life Coordinator): shainiya.balachandran@utoronto.ca</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Important: Please write to us at least two weeks in advance if you would like to book the bar to allow enough time for Food Services to book a bartender. Leaving your assessment until too late risks you losing the bar!</p>

<p>The bar offers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Beers</li>
    <li>Wines</li>
    <li>Mixed Drinks</li>
    <li>Free snacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The bar may come with set-up and operational costs - contact us to negotiate this cost.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px;font-weight: bold">And That's It!</p>

<p>No forms to fill out, no booking fees! Our staff is happy to help set up and run the event with you, and to answer any questions you may have - just look for the Cat's Eye sweaters!</p>
