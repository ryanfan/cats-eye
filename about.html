<h1 class="page-heading">About Us</h1>

<p style="font-size:15px;font-weight: bold">What are we?</p>

<p>We are an accessible student-run lounge, located in the basement of the Goldring Center at Victoria College (150 Charles St. West). A team of 2 co-managers and 30 volunteer subcommittee members run the space!</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;font-weight: bold">When are we open?</p>

<p>Monday through Friday, from 9:00 am to 11:00 pm!</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;font-weight: bold">What can I do at the Cat’s Eye?</p>

<p>Depends on your interests! Some students come to meet their friends (or make new ones!), nap, get some work done, and others come for the events, the video games, to play pool, table tennis or for foosball. We’re a positive space, and there’s room for just about anything!</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;font-weight: bold">Can I book the Cat’s Eye for my event?</p>

<p>Groups from Victoria College can book the space – either VUSAC-recognized or residence groups! Check out the “The Space” for details on the space, the amenities, and our equipment.</p>

<p style="font-size:15px;font-weight: bold">This is great, how do I get involved?</p>

<p>We hire for co-manager twice a year, and subcommittee in September, check out “Getting Involved” for details and applications!</p>
